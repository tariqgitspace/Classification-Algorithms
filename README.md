# Classification-Algorithms -> Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forests, Boosting and Naïve Bayes

 Implement three classification algorithms by yourself: Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, and Naïve Bayes.
 Implement Random Forests based on your own implementation of Decision Tree.
 Implement Boosting based on your own implementation of Decision Tree.
 Adopt 10-fold Cross Validation to evaluate the performance of all methods on the provided two datasets in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-1 measure
